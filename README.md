# LocAnalysis
My program "LocAnalysis" uses a combination of .txt output files from the Trikinetics Locomotor Activity Monitor device and a meta dataset that includes information on each test subject to create plots, perform statistical analyses, and generate predictions.


### In development

LocAnalysis is still under development. If you would like to install the program locally to help work on the code, please follow the instructions below:

```
conda install [list dependencies here...] -c conda-forge

git clone [myproject-link]

cd ./myproject-name

pip install -e .
```
