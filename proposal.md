# project
An outline of a new project idea (for now)


### Description of project goal
My project will provide tools to analyze Locomotor Activity Monitor (LAM) data and return plots of daily circadian rhythm, 3D scatter analysis, etc. of activity counts.


### Description of the code:
I will be using the following packages to organize data sets and perform statistical analyses as well as generate plots.
`os`: to perform operating system tasks.
`pandas`: to organize and analyze data.
`numpy`: to organize and analyze data.
`scikit-learn`: to perform statistical analyses and train and predict models.
`pyplot`: to create graphs.


### Description of the data:
I will be using standard .txt files generated from the Trikinetics Locomotor Activity Monitor device along with CSV data input by the user.


### Description of user interaction:
The user will need to organize and align .txt files, whereas meta-dataset (CSV file) with data labels and parameters can vary according to the user's needs.
